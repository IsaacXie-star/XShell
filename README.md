# XShell
A simple shell that supports pipelining, redirection, and listing ...

Note: Since this shell does not have environment variable feature,
make sure to specify the exact executable, for example, use 
"/bin/ls" instead of "ls", "/bin/wc" instead of "wc"

To clear screen, use clear directly instead of "/bin/clear"
To exit, use "exit"
